# File System Photo Album
> A simple, file-system-based Photo Album server and client

This app was conceived because I have several directories full of old photos, and wanted to create an extremely simple album viewer.

## What this project isn't:

This is not and will never be a photo album suitable for public hosting! Don't use it for such. I made this to host on a private network on top of a directory full of images and subdirectories full of images, and it minimal checking.
